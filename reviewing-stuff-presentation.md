#### Edit me
* The purpose of the talk is to inspire people to review, be reviewed, and do those things well.
* I will present this as slides for a 5 or 10 minute lightning talk on 22nd September and miss out this first slide
* Nothing is sacred - ruthless editing and deleting will be required to get the most useful information across in the short time.

* Text with #### before it will be a new slide title, *s are used for slide bullet points
* Any text after bullet points I'll consider to be speaker notes
* This presentation is more about content than formatting but comments on how best to show/present it are also welcome.
* Comments in other formats welcome too (in person, email grahamthecoder@gmail.com or tweet @grahamthecoder)

####Reviewing stuff - it's important.

####Everything should be reviewable
* Improve quality
* Learn from others
* Teach others

#### Everything should be reviewable online
* Allows asynchronous working
* Allows remote working
* Time to think and research before replying
* Documents decisions and reasons

#### Problem - misunderstandings
* Communication is hard
* Desired response
* Importance
* Tone
* Depends on mood/rapport

People tend to underestimate how hard and time-consuming communication can be.
In text form, it's hard to tell whether someone needs a response, and what response they're hoping for.
It's also hard to discern the relative importance of a comment, and how much someone cares about it.
The success of communication depends on each individual's and the pair's rapport.
It's easy to blame other people, but what's really going on, and how can we do it better?

#### Giving feedback
* Keep comments short
  * Explain your view of something you've observed
  * Ask a specific question if you want a specific response
* Consider prefixing with Must, Should, Could
* If you notice emotive language being used, try to speak in person or via Skype to allow both of you to reset your "tone gauge".
* In a longer discussion, make sure you know who's making the final decision.

#### Remember
* Learning to respond to and accept this kind of feedback takes time. Most people's instinct is to respond defensively.
* Answer all comments unless it is clear that the discussion has come to a close. If you're under time pressure which is influencing the discussion or your decision then say so.
* If you're going around in circles, talk in person, but post the result of the discussion so it's still recorded.
* Try to give the benefit of the doubt
